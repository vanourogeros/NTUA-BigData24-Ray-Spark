In here there are scripts that extract meaningful features (MFSCs) from audio files from the RAVDESS dataset for speech emotion recognition. 
"Inspired" from this notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/vidhuran07/speech-emotion-recognition-ipynb.
To run, simply call each script with python. For the Spark script, specify the number of executors (i.e. worker machines) as the first argument.
